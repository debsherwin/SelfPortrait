<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Heartland Alliance’s work with vulnerable populations is wide scope, but it needed to communicate its mission in a simple, easy-to-remember way across print and digital channels. 
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Demonstrate the breadth and impact of Heartland Alliance's programs</li>
		<li>Feature clients as agents of their own success</li>
		<li>Communicate Heartland’s unique passion for their work</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>We collaborated with the internal editorial team to bring Heartland’s various initiatives into sharp focus: Ending Poverty. We developed and deployed new brand messaging around their key strategies for achieving that outcome: housing, healthcare, jobs and justice. Annual reports, donor brochures and internal communications helped spread the message. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>We successfully engaged donors and the public at large, meeting and exceeding fundraising goals. We also reinvigorated organizational morale with the clarity of the mission. The identity system empowered Heartland’s communications team to fully adopt and extend the new look and messaging.
