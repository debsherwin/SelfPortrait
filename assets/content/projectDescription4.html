<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>WaterSmart’s customer onboarding process was not scalable. It was a months-long process conducted through emails and spreadsheets. It required detailed oversight by a dedicated Customer Success manager and Operations engineer due the fact that a) water utility data sets are highly heterogeneous b) WaterSmart’s product is highly configurable.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>‘Productize’ repetitive parts of the process to make onboarding as self-service as possible</li>
		<li>Clearly communicate onboarding status internally and externally</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I interviewed stakeholders from across the business—Customer Success, Sales, Engineering, Marketing, and Product—to uncover the aspects of onboarding that were repeated consistently and could benefit from standardization. On the customer side, I ran a survey of newly onboarded customers to gather qualitative feedback on their pain points.</p>

<p>These discussions surfaced multiple redundant processes that could be unified. I created a new intake protocol that spanned contracting, Salesforce and our product platform to create a ‘single source of truth’ 
for configuration. Throughout the design, I led a cross-departmental task force to validate decisions.</p>

<p>To streamline the experience for our utility customers, I created a suite of setup modules in their Dashboard that became available as soon as their contract was signed. This enabled utility staff to view the status of their data transfer, manage team members, customize their settings, track outstanding tasks and access proprietary support content. For each module, I ran internal reviews to assess usability, and external interviews to validate the language and organization.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>WaterSmart’s customers now have immediate access to their Dashboard. WaterSmart staff can execute onboarding with greater speed and consistency.
