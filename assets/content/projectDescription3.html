<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Algorithms and machine learning can identify leaks in water consumption data. However, identifying the leak is just the first step. Water utilities need their consumers to be able to self-resolve leaks with minimal use of utility staff time. The offline and online experience must be considered as a single workflow.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Automate alerts to consumers about potential leaks</li>
		<li>Make leak data actionable</li>
		<li>Enable utility to track status of leak events</li> 
		<li>Reduce utility staff time addressing leaks</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>We heard from utilities that unclear alerts prompted consumers to call the utility alarmed. We also knew that requiring opt-in for alert subscriptions limits their reach and that requiring authentication for leak-related content results in a large bounce rate.</p>

<p>I designed an alert email with a simple chart to illustrate the problem and with language that communicated an appropriate level of urgency. The chart is accompanied by clear calls to action that use tokens to direct the recipient into a personalized self-service workflow. The email is opt-out to ensure it reaches to most possible recipients, and the subscription can be managed by both the consumer and utility staff.</p>

<p>The workflow captures the user’s progress and reports that back to the utility. Once the workflow was in use, we found that users identified most leaks as toilets or irrigation, so we revised the workflow sequence to surface that information first.</p>

<blockquote>"We are very grateful for the water alerts.  The last water leak was so deep we would never have found it without the alert message.
Thank you."</blockquote>


<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The leak resolution system successfully saved water and prevented expensive water bills and property damage. From 2015-2018, we saved 336,000 gallons of water across all utilities with alerting enabled. This helped build positive relationships between consumers and their water utilities. And it saved valuable staff time on outreach and responding to high bill calls.</p>

<p>The emails were also an effective method to drive further digital engagement with the Customer Portal. It had greater than 60% open rates and an 11% follow-on portal registration rate. This far outpaced other types of letters promoting registration.</p>

<p>Once the success of email alerts was established, we expanded alert channels to text, voice and print—working with an on-demand printing api. This opened a new revenue stream for WaterSmart and enabled us 
to reach a wider audience.</p>
