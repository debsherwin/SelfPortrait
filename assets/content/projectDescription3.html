<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Agricultural asset managers, ag investors, agri-businesses, and crop insurance providers have access to a host of tools to monitor their assets and liabilities. But they lack an integrated view of their entire portfolio from which to derive insights.

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0 !important;">Combine the analytics derived from Ceres Imaging’s proprietary dataset with a flexible interface in order to:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>Provide one-click visibility of a broad dataset—across time, geographies, and crop types</li>
	<li>Communicate productive capacity of permanent and annual crop holdings for assessing yield potential and land value.</li>
	<li>Support large operators and asset managers to identify in-season risks for contracting their yield </li>
	<li>Identify opportunities for sustainability managing input costs (fertilizer, pesticides) and operating practices (tillage, irrigation)</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I defined a modular dashboard <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">ui</span> with status indicators, trend charts, interactive data grids, and maps. I worked with the Product leads, a <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">pmm</span>, enterprise Sales reps, and <span style="font-variant: small-caps;font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;">r&d</span> to translate their product discovery into discrete packages of metrics that addressed user needs and could be marketed independently. I vetted usability and content design via a continuous feedback loop with Sales and design reviews with early-adopter prospects. And I shipped the product via diligent alignment of Figma specs with product documentation, as well as extensive hands-on testing during iterative development sprints.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>As a neutral third-party view into agricultural assets for stakeholders at all levels of the supply chain, Portfolio Insights positions Ceres Imaging to be an institutional player as the agricultural sector matures in its digital transformation.</p>
