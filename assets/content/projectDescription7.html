<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Loyola University Health system had a year's worth of successes stories to promote in across multiple channels.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Communicate fortitude in the face of a rapidly changing industry</li>
		<li>Showcase both the achievements of Loyolaâ€™s medical leadership and patient stories</li>
		<li>Produce Loyola's first digital annual report</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>We organized the doctor's and researcher's stories under the Stronger messaging, and set it in parallel to the patient stories under the Healthier heading. Because the website would be navigated non-linearly, with readers diving in and out of individually stories, we decided to emphasize a non-linear narrative for the print as well.</p>
