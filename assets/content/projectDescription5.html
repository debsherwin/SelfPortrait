<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Educational publisher Zoobooks wanted to reach a new market—parents of children 0-3—in a cost-effective way.  
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Extend the Zoobooks magazine product line with age-appropriate content</li>
		<li>Include interactive experiences for parents that go ‘beyond the page’</li>
		<li>Create evergreen content that can be republished as children age out of the subscription</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I reviewed a wide range of books and magazines for very young children to understand what made for a visually engaging experience. I also researched key concepts in early childhood development which we could feature: high contrast, shape, color, motion, interpersonal relationships, and facial expressions. </p>

<p>This translated into a serializable magazine concept with a consistent structure: ‘meeting’ the animal, exploring the animal’s physical attributes and actions, and ending with a rhyme and a game. We offered parents a tip guide and prompted them to point, open flaps, make funny noises and offer snuggles at appropriate moments.</p>

<p>We used ‘elephants’ to demonstrate the concept, and I audited Zoobooks existing photography library to create an ‘editorial calendar’ of animals with the most assets available.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The concept was approved and we were engaged to fully produce the first six issues, available at zoobooks.com.
