<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Ceres Imaging collects aerial imagery of agricultural land to provide bird’s-eye views of crop health and irrigation problems. To-date, these analytic assessments were delivered to the farm manager in a static image format—a format that could only be ‘read’ by a trained human who could ‘eyeball’ problem patterns or trends.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use a vector-based map to unlock the quantified data in the aerial imagery</li>
	<li>Enable an untrained user to identify salient patterns and trends</li>
	<li>Visualize the impact of actions taken in-field</li>
	<li>Aggregate insights across fields</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>This paradigm shift in Ceres’s customer-facing deliverable was developed in several phases over multiple growing seasons. In all phases, my role was to align our dataset with the real-world management workflows of our farm managers.

<p>In the first phase, I conducted discovery sessions to understand the key points of their workflow. Identifying high variability within a field, was a priority. So when we introduced vector-based map layers with tree- and vine-level data, these layers came packaged with a dynamic ‘histo-legend’ that a) described the metric b) displayed the distribution and c) acted as a  clickable filter to find and count the most-stressed plants.</p>

<p>We contained the “histo-legend” in a flexible panel that could be progressively revealed, or made compact, depending on screen size or the scope of data in the view.</p>

<p>User feedback was overwhelmingly positive: the bar chart view was easy to understand at a glance and could be communicated clearly to upper management. But it was still difficult to compare one distribution to another, to understand if field actions effectively improved crop health.</p>

<p>So in the next phase—in addition to supporting a wider variety of crops with a variety of new data granularities—we curated charts to highlight important comparisons. Water Stress is expected to change week-to-week, so a ‘Tornado chart” illustrates short-term changes. Vegetative metrics follow a slow curve, so they have a time series of the field average that can be compared year-over-year.</p>

<p>This feature set was also well-received by farm managers, but the value was bottle-necked by the fact that the user had to navigate through individual farms and fields to find the direction of each trend. Our response was to aggregate and rank field- and zone-level in the map view and on a dedicated summary page.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Farm managers across four continents are able to analyze millions of acres, enabling them to precisely target water, fertilizer, and labor.</p>
