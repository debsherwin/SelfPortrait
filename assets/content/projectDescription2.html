<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Water utility staff do not have an easy way to reach constituents quickly to communicate urgent service information or to promote programs and events. They rely on printed bill inserts which are neither timely 
nor targeted.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Add a digital messaging workflow to the WaterSmart Dashboard</li>
		<li>Leverage reporting in the platform to select contacts</li>
		<li>Reach those contacts in a personalized way with minimal effort</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I designed a Builder <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">ui</span>  element to walk the user through the various steps of composing content and selecting contacts. We did a soft launch of email messaging with beta users and used their feedback to improve the workflow. We also improved targeting capabilities based on the use cases they demonstrated. When demand was sufficient, we added text and voice messaging.
</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Utility staff are delighted with how easily they can perform outreach. With no <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">pr</span> or marketing training, they can proactively communicate instead of reacting 
to complaints. Within 18 months it was adopted by 45% of the utility user base and over 420,000 individual messages were delivered. </p>
