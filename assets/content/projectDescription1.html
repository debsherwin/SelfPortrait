[before/after]

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>This project represents a key moment in WaterSmart’s business when we reoriented development away from end-consumers to water utility staff, whom represented our biggest opportunity for revenue growth. The existing Dashboard contained basic success metrics on the Water Report program and a place to post ad hoc reports created on a consultative basis. The team was challenged to reinvision the platform from the ground up with a fresh codebase and visual design.
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Position analytics as the core of the product</li>
	<li>Create a more user-oriented experience</li>
	<li>Focus on habitual needs, vs ad hoc uses</li>
	<li>Deliver actionable data reporting in a scalable way</li>
	<li>Visualize data for easy insights</li>
	<li>Develop a modular design to support product growth</li>
	</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>
<p>I worked directly with a Product Manager who defined personas, led user research and proposed conceptual designs. When defining the visual approach, I aimed to provide generous amounts of white space—stripping away any type of contrast that did not provide useful information. I also aimed limited the number of series plotted on individual charts to aid comprehension. I iterated on wireframes, edited content, gathered internal feedback, specced the visual elements for all the initial modules, and reviewed the product for quality through ongoing sprint releases. Through phased launches we validated that the features aligned with our defined Jobs-to-be-Done while using Engineering hours efficiently.
</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>I established a modular <span>ui</span> system to simplify expanding the Dashboard as new market opportunities arise. It consists of Modules (report-based pages), Tile data elements, Chart displays, and end-consumer account pages. I also defined the display of Data Grids, the core data table element of the platform for viewing, filtering and downloading data sets.

Over 100 utilities rely on the Dashboard for analyzing water consumption, communicating with their customers, resolving leaks and administering conservation programs.</p>
