<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>WaterSmart Software offers water utilities SaaS tools for engaging their communities. To date, development had focused on experiences for citizens, while only a rudimentary dashboard was available to utility staff for reporting statistics on the engagement program. Utilities are WaterSmart's source of revenue, so focusing on them made business sense. As a team we decided to re-design the Dashboard from the ground up, which offered a number of opportunities:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Reorient our Product Design process aroung the utility-user experience.</li>
	<li>Grow the business by adding value to our platform. New Analytics products and Customer Service tools would address utilitys' perennial—rather than cyclical—needs.</li>
	<li>Establish modular UI components that could support the platform as it grew.</li>
	<li>Rethink the visual design to make large data sets easy to access, understand, and act upon.</li>
	<li>Remove legacy code that was not scalable</li>
	</ul></p>

My personal mantra to tie it all together was: "give utility staff confidence and control."

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>My team included:
<ul><li>Myself: Information Design, Interface Developerssign</li>
<li>Emily Kleeman: Product Management, User Research</li>
<li>WaterSmart Developers</li></ul></p>

<p>Emily conducted user inteviews, defined Jobs-to-be-Done and provided conceptual wireframes. I synthesized her research, iterated on the wireframes, and gathered internal feedback to realize the designs for the modules that were slated for the first release. We were excited about a wide range of features, but at this stage WaterSmart had only a handful of utility customers, so we pushed ourselves to aggressively limit scope. We prioritized building a minimally meaningful product so we could validate our assumptions, learn from our users, and test the market response.</p>

<p>Visually I aimed to provide generous amounts of white space to enable users to focus, stripping away any type of contrast that did not provide useful information. I hoped this would and make the large data sets approachable, and provide a respite from the overwhelmingly dense interfaces common to utility legacy systems.</p>

<p>Once finalized, I provided specifications for all the visual elements to hand of to the Dev team, and worked collaboratively with them through several sprints to implement. Throughout, I reviewed output for quality.</p>


<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>I designed a number of core UI components are central to the platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Modules</span> for organizing related data sets into pages with visualizations. Within Modules, Tiles subdivide pages with heterogenous information in a consistent way. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Data Grids</span> for interacting with large tables of data. With a few clicks, utility staff can search, preview, filter, and download data that used to days to aquire from other parts of their organziation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Charts</span> for visualizing. I set styles that were both limited in color and content, restricting the number of series plotted to aid comprehension.</p>
[image]
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Customer Details page</span> with account-level data and analysis. This empowers utility call center staff to have productive converations with customers concerned about their water use.</p>

<p>Once established this system made it easy to enhance the Dashboard in a scalable way as we received user feedback and new market signals. I have helped maintain and enhance this system for a number of years, and supported its adoption by other Product Design team members. Today the Utility Dashboard serves 500 staff members in 80 utilities across the US and UK in critical daily tasks: communicating with customers, resolving leaks, and administering programs.</p>
